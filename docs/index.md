### Learn English by watching movies on ORORO.TV

One of the ways to learn English is watching movies. There are many services to do it,
one ot them is [ORORO.TV](https://ororo.tv/ref/1530022), which provides subtitles and
translator allowing to translate unknown words or whole sentences while viewing.

### Recent Subtitles extension

However at some level it may not be highly efficiently to read subtitles constantly
not really trying to perceive native speech aurally. At the same time it's important
not to lose the meaning of the movie and be in the context every time.
[ORORO.TV Recent Subtitles](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ororotv-recent-subtitles/aebfghlgckigccknbckmejjnlaloeeei?hl=en)
extension for Chrome allows watching without subtitles showing them on pause
and making possible just look through them to catch the sense.

### Screenshots

By the way, **_Shift+S_** shortcut can be used to toggle subtitles when the movie is on pause.
It may be useful in case when needed to view the frame in details.
